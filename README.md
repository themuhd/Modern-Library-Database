# Modern-Library-Database

Design of a database system for a library that would store 
information on members, their library catalogue, loan history, and overdue fine repayments
based on client's specification. The library requires a comprehensive system with an online signup and login feature, repayment of overdue fines, and calculation of overdue fees. The client also 
needed a backup system to prevent data loss in case of system failure.
